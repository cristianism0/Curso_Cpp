### C++ key points

##### Syntax:
- C++ is ==case sensitive==
- Usually uses a header file library
- Every C++ statements ends with a semicolon ;
- The body of a function is build like: ==type== function () {}
- The variable declaration is build like: ==type== variableName = value; 
---
##### Variables Types and Identifiers:
- ==int==: stores integers numbers
- ==double==: stores floating point numbers, with decimals
- ==char==: stores SINGLE characters like 'b' or 'F', with **single quotes**
- ==string==: stores text, uses **double quotes**
- ==boolean==: stores _true (1)_ or _false (0)_
- _auto_: identifies a variable type

- Identifiers are the variables names, usually they are descriptive
- We cannot use _special chars_ in variables identifiers or start with numbers
- It cannot be a type or function name 
- They are case sensitive

###### Logical Operators;
_Other operations are similar to Python_
- &&: Logical _and_: Returns TRUE if both are TRUE
- ||: Logical _or_: Returns TRUE if one of them is TRUE
- !: Reverse: If a statement is true, !statement is false.
